# Public Documentation

This folder contains contributor-facing documentation tracked in git.

## Read First

1. `INSTALL.md` — local setup, build, test, run paths.
2. `../CONTRIBUTING.md` — canonical contribution workflow and guardrails.
3. `ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md` — canonical host/CLI/shared boundaries and storage layout.
4. `SECURITY_MODEL.md` — safety model, secrets, and trust boundaries.
5. `RELEASE.md` — signed/notarized DMG pipeline from host archive output.

## Feature Docs

- `EXTENSIONS_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT.md` — architecture + DX audit and prioritized roadmap.
- `ADR-EXTENSIONS-PACKAGE-MANIFEST.md` — package manifest + installer architecture decision.
- `ADR-MODS-SCHEMA-RESET-V1.md` — clean-slate `ui.mod.json` schema reset + breaking-change policy.

## Notes

- `docs/` is private planning memory and intentionally not part of public contributor docs.
- `mods/first-party/` contains first-party exemplar mod packages; third-party mods should live in external repos.
- Canonical GUI entrypoint is `apps/CodexChatHost`.
- `apps/CodexChatApp` is shared logic + contributor CLI (`CodexChatCLI`).
- Preferred onboarding command is `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh`.
- Hosted GitHub Actions is budget mode and runs quick smoke only (`make quick`).
- Preferred local gate before push is `make prepush-local`.
- Shell workspace UI favors minimal chrome: icon-only multi-shell rail on the left, near full-bleed terminal space on the right, and monochrome shell surfaces (white/light, black/dark).
- Live activity traces use compact one-word status labels by default and only expand into a trace box when rich trace details are available.
